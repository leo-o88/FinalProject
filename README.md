# FinalProject
For this project it would be helpful to have a familiarity with the following topics/concepts:

Calculus, specifically calculating area under a curve
Counting and statistics associated with counting
Different types of particles, specifically, Neutrons and Gamma-Rays.
Although not necessary, familiarity with what Photomultiplier are and 
how we interpret their responses would be useful
Same for scintillator material, not necessary but helpful.
